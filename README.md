# Hi there 👋. Abhishek Deyol here... a.k.a. everrover

I'm a Software Engineer👨🏻‍💻 with a deep-rooted interest in building scalable, performant, and secure user-centric web-applications in a dynamic and fast-paced organization. I have an ever-growing hunger for knowledge(especially in technology) and I'm relentless when it comes to improving my skills and knowledge. This, I'm aware, is essential to not only me but the organization I work with as well.

I am keenly interested in the intersection of business and technology, and I intend to keep learning about it and hence utilize my expertise, skills and knowledge to create a profound impact... wherever I get the chance to work.

**Recent achievement🏆**: Learnt **Golang** a few days back for some new project.

**Fun fact🤔**: I am currently learning about Cybersecurity via CTFs, Malware-development, and research work. Let's collaborate if needed.
