# Hi there 👋. Call me _Deyol_(or _Mr.Rover_) please

**Recent achievement🏆**: Finished milestone of resolving 160 problems at Leetcode. [`mount-kronos`](https://github.com/everrover/mount-kronos)

I am currently in full research mode for Cybersecurity for a secret project. Currently am learning about Malware development and code design and architecture(low-level and high-level). Yes, I'm an oddball, but... who isn't.

**Fun fact🤔**: I freaking love beer🍺 with a big lemon slice🍋. In fact, I love lemon with everything. And... can't live or work without a dose of music daily🎶🎵.
